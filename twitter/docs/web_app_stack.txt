Front End

HTML5/JavaScript. Creates JSON objects to be sent to the server. Receives the same from the server.

Back End

Web Service (Jersey/Jackson) - Converts JSON to a Java object and vice versa.
Data Layer (Spring/Hibernate) - ORM: converts Java object to a format compatible with relational database and vice versa.
MySQL Database - stores converted JSON objects for retrieval.
One additional question:

As I understand it, Jersey is an implementation of JAX-RS. What exactly is the relationship between Jersey and Jackson? Is Jackson simply an "add-on" that allows Jersey to serialize JSON objects into Java objects and vice versa?
Thank you very much for your guidance!
